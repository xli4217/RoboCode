# Task ID: 1
# Title: Model Survey and Database Creation
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a comprehensive catalog of open-source code-focused models with required metadata collection through manual research, focusing specifically on models designed for code generation, completion, and understanding tasks
# Details:
Create comprehensive documentation and spreadsheets to:
1. Research and document code-focused models like CodeLlama, StarCoder, CodeT5, WizardCoder, DeepSeek Coder from Hugging Face and other sources
2. Maintain metadata in structured Excel/CSV files
3. Create filtering views using spreadsheet functions
4. Document model versions and relevant links
5. Organize data in multiple worksheet tabs
Spreadsheet Structure:
- model_name
- version
- parameter_count
- license
- context_window
- benchmark_scores (focusing on code-specific benchmarks like HumanEval, MBPP)
- training_data (code repositories, programming languages covered)
- fine_tuning_details
- code_specific_features
- last_updated
- source_url
- deployment_requirements
- notes

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify completeness of model catalog against known code models
2. Validate accuracy of metadata collection
3. Test filtering and sorting functionality
4. Check data consistency across worksheets
5. Verify all code-specific benchmarks are properly documented
